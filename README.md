# SMLReader
ESP8266 based SmartMeter (SML) to 1-Wire gateway

## Description
The aim of this project is to read the meter readings of modern energy meters and make them available via the 1-Wire bus.

The project was primarily developed and tested for the EMH ED300L electricity meter, but should also work with other energy meters that have an optical interface and communicate via the SML protocol.
